# GoStudyApp
This is an application run locally on your computer but used in-browser for studying Go.
It is recommended to run Go Study app using a modern browser such as Chrome or Firefox to ensure all features will function.
It is also recommended to turn off pop-up blocking as the Go Study App uses alerts.

TO RUN THIS APPLICATION:
First, you must have node.js installed on your machine.
Once you have cloned this repository and installed node, run the following command from inside the repository directory on your local machine:
npm install

Run the following command from the directory where you cloned this repo:
node GoStudyNode.js
Do not stop the running of this node while you are using the application.
When you are done using the app you can stop running the node by pressing ctrl-c in the terminal window you ran node from.

Now to use the application open your web browser (ideally firefox or chrome) and input the url:
localhost:3030


Go Study App is an auto-saving application designed for a single user.  There is not functionality for multiple different
collections of notes and proverbs on a given copy (but it is relatively small file wise, so if you want
multiple discrete instances of go notes and proverbs just clone additional copies of this repository/release).

Currently this application is still in development and so a number of basic log to the javascript console
take place both in browser and on the node.js server.  These are left-in for the purpose of debugging,
maintenance, and illustrating functionality in videos that must be submitted of this project
since it is a class assignment for OSU's Software Engineering course.
